# EndoscopePi5

A backup of the code on the Pi5 provided by Acuity for Project 164: Endoscope.

> [!CAUTION]
The repository provides the scripts directory at the same level as the `endo_ws` but the ROS node for working with the external LEDs calls a script with a hardcoded path requiring the scripts directory to be at `/home/pharos/scripts/`.
